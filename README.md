and the choices are pretty casul such as choice of
-colour<br />
-music<br />
-beverage<br />
-alchol<br />

**Inside the project** - prject oonsists of 
-> Data loading/ precrocessing
-> finding correlation between different features with target variable
-> Data visualization
-> Comparing different classification models
     -Logistic regressio
     -SVC model
     -Decision tree classifer
     -K-neighbours classisfer
     -Random forest regressor
     -Gradient boosing classifier
