# Gender-Classifier
> This project uses interactive data to work on a model that will predict the output
the output uses the input to determine weather the user is a male or a female
and the choices are pretty casul such as choice of<br />


## About data
Data contains choices of several indivisuals involved in an experiment. Choices such as
- colour<br />
- music<br />
- beverage<br />
- alchol<br />

## Inside the project 
<!-- prject oonsists of <br /> -->
-> Data loading/ precrocessing<br />
-> finding correlation between different features with target variable <br />
-> Data visualization <br />
-> Comparing different classification models

## MOdels used
1. Logistic regression <br /> 
2. SVC model
3. Decision tree classifer
4. K-neighbours classisfer
5. Random forest regressor
6. Gradient boosing classifier
